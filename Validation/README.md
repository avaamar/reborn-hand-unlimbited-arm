# Validation and Testing

This folder contains documentation of mechanical tests, fit checks, and motion evaluations.

## Purpose
- Confirm correct articulation and range of motion.
- Evaluate hinge performance and return mechanisms.
- Check assembly tolerances and friction points.
- Validate load resistance and comfort (for scaled model).

## For the test hand
Validation was performed **by the makers** to ensure print quality and mechanical functionality before scaling.

## For the prosthesis (Manon Smesman)
Validation confirmed motion, comfort, and range of motion after scaling to her specific measurements.

Include test logs, results tables, and photos in this folder.
