# CAD Files

This folder contains the parametric and exported 3D models used for the design.  
Whenever possible, both **source files** (e.g., `.scad`, `.f3d`, `.step`) and **printable exports** (`.stl`, `.3mf`) should be included.

## Notes
- Large files should be stored using **Git LFS** if they exceed 50â€“100 MB.
- Each file should include its version or scaling factor in the filename.
- The current models correspond to the Phoenix UnLimbited geometry for the test hand, and to the scaled Reborn Hand / UnLimbited Arm geometry for Manon Smesman.
