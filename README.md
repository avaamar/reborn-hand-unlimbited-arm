# Reborn Hand (Remix of Phoenix Hand & UnLimbited Arm)

This repository documents the **final 3D-printed arm prosthesis** built for **Manon Smesman**,  
based on the **Reborn Hand** remix (derived from the Phoenix Hand and UnLimbited Arm).  

The prosthesis was **custom-scaled to Manon Smesman’s arm dimensions** using the validated parameters from the earlier makers’ test hand.  
This build combines the structural reliability of the UnLimbited Arm with the functional hand geometry of the Phoenix series.

---

## Context
- The prototype test hand (see separate repository) was created first for validation and assembly practice.  
- After successful validation, this full-scale prosthesis was adapted and printed to match Manon Smesman’s specific forearm length and grip requirements.

## References (original design)
- **Thingiverse** – *Reborn Hand: Remix of Phoenix Hand & UnLimbited Arm* (original source and license details).  
- Derived from e-NABLE’s open-source Phoenix and UnLimbited design families.

## Printing Parameters
- **Material:** PETG (structural), TPU (flexible sleeves or straps)  
- **Layer height:** 0.2 mm  
- **Perimeters:** 4  
- **Infill:** 40–60 % (structural) / 20–30 % (non-structural)  
- **Top/bottom thickness:** ≥ 1.2 mm  
- **Scaling:** Adjusted to fit Manon Smesman’s forearm and hand dimensions.  
- **Orientation:** per part notes for maximum strength along load axes.

## Assembly and Fitting
- Follow standard Phoenix/UnLimbited tendon routing guidelines.  
- Verify forearm socket fit and alignment with residual limb.  
- Check hinge smoothness and cable tension.  
- Use heat-set inserts and threadlocker where specified.  
- Fit testing and comfort adjustments documented in `Assembly/` and `Validation/`.
