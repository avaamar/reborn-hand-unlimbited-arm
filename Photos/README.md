# Photos and Visual Documentation

This folder stores photos, renders, and diagrams of the printed parts and assemblies.

## Include
- Build process photos (printing, post-processing, assembly)
- Final prototype and scaled prosthesis images
- Annotated diagrams showing cable routing or hinge positions

Images should be named consistently, e.g.:
`assembly_step1.jpg`, `testhand_sideview.jpg`, `arm_scaled_fit.jpg`.
