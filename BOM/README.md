## 1. Non-Printable Materials

| Category | Material | Description / Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Elastic** | Elastic cord | 1 mm or 2 mm diameter elastic cord for tendon return. About 50 cm per device. Preferred in warm regions where dental elastics are difficult to source. |
| **Dental elastics** | Orthodontic elastic bands | Used on Phoenix / Raptor / UnLimbited hands. Typically sizes 3/8" or 1/4" (force range 95 – 135 %). |
| **Screws** | Stainless-steel M3 screws | Used to adjust tendon tension and fix parts. Prefer cross-head stainless screws with rounded or conical heads. For a 100 %-scale hand, 6 mm to 8 mm long M3 screws are suitable. |
| **Nylon fishing line** | Tendon cable | Non-elastic nylon line (0.4 – 0.6 mm diameter). Used for flexion tendons. Available in the fishing or beading section. |
| **Crimp beads or tubes** | Cable terminations | Used to secure the ends of nylon tendons. Insert the line, crimp with pliers. Found in jewellery or fishing sections. |
| **Plasti-Dip** | Finger coating | Applied to fingertips to provide grip. Substitute for silicone finger caps. |
| **Foam** | Soft padding | 2 mm – 5 mm thick foam to protect the user’s skin or the test surface. EVA or similar. |
| **Velcro straps** | Attachment straps | 1 m of 25 mm wide hook-and-loop (Velcro). One side sewn or glued to the arm brace. |
| **Misc. hardware** | Heat-set inserts | M3 inserts installed with a soldering iron. |

## 2. Tools Required

| Tool | Purpose / Notes |
|------|-----------------|
| Scissors (pointed) | Cutting elastic or replacing an awl. |
| Awl or punch | For threading tendons and elastics. |
| Soldering iron / pyrograph | To melt or reform PLA edges, install inserts. |
| Metal file | For smoothing joint surfaces. |
| Utility cutter | General trimming and cleanup. |
| Pliers | For holding or pulling tendon ends, crimping beads. |
| Screwdrivers | Matching the screw head type used. |
| Hammer | Used lightly for press fits or crimping beads. |
| Heat gun (or hair dryer) | Thermoforming thin parts if needed. |
| Hot-glue gun | Attaching Velcro, foam pads, or grip coatings. |
| Deburring tool | For removing sharp edges and “elephant’s foot” on prints. |

| 5 | Misc | Foam padding | 1 | 2–5 mm thick |
| 6 | Fastener | Velcro strap | 1 m | 25 mm width |
| 7 | Grip | Plasti-Dip | — | Finger coating |
| 8 | Dental | Orthodontic elastics | several | Sizes 3/8" and 1/4" |

Update with suppliers and costs as you build.

## 4. Notes
- All items listed here are required for **assembly and testing**; none are 3D-printed.
- Quantities may vary slightly depending on scale or modifications.
- For Manon Smesman’s final prosthesis, the same materials were used, scaled proportionally to her arm size.
