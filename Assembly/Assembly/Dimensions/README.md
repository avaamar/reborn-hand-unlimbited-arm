# Dimensions and Fitting Reference — Manon Smesman

This folder contains the **dimensional references and fitting documentation** used to design and scale the Phoenix Arm prosthesis for **Manon Smesman**.

---

## Purpose
The materials in this folder were provided **by Manon Smesman’s parents** to allow the makers to:
- Record the forearm and hand dimensions accurately.
- Scale the prosthesis model proportionally for comfort and functionality.
- Verify alignment and geometry before printing the final device.

These references were essential for adapting the Reborn Hand / UnLimbited Arm model to Manon’s specific anatomy.

---

## Contents
- **Photographs** of Manon’s arms and forearms (shared with parental consent).
- **Measurement overlays** or annotations indicating:
  - Total forearm length.
  - Wrist-to-elbow distance.
  - Circumferences and reference widths.
- **Scaling notes** used to adjust CAD model dimensions.

## Privacy and Data Protection
- These files are **confidential** and must **not be shared publicly** without explicit written permission from Manon’s parents or guardians.
- If this repository is public, **do not upload any identifiable images** here.  
  Instead, store them **offline or in a private shared folder**, and include only:
  - anonymized diagrams,  
  - measurement tables, or  
  - silhouette overlays that do not reveal personal identity.
- Only authorized team members working on the prosthesis fitting may access the original photos.
