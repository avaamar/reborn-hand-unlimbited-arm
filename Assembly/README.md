# Assembly Instructions

This folder contains the documentation, photos, and notes related to the assembly of the Phoenix Arm prosthesis.

---

## Purpose
To guide the assembly of the printed components, fasteners, and elastic elements used to build both:
- the **prototype test hand** (validation stage), and  
- the **final scaled prosthesis** made for **Manon Smesman**.

---

## Assembly Overview
- Follow the standard **Phoenix / Reborn Hand** and **UnLimbited Arm** assembly procedures.  
- Install cords, elastics, and screws according to e-NABLE guidelines.  
- Use heat-set inserts and threadlocker where specified.  
- Verify smooth hinge motion before final tensioning.

## Dimensional Specifications (Manon Smesman)
The prosthesis was scaled according to measurements provided by Manon’s parents:

| Measurement | Description | Value |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Biceps circumference | Measured at the widest part of the upper arm | **18.5 cm** |
| Elbow crease to wrist joint | Distance from the inside of the elbow to the wrist articulation | **11.5 cm** |

These dimensions were used to scale the CAD model proportionally and to ensure proper socket fit and forearm length.

## Assembly Notes
- Dry-fit components before final fastening.  
- Check that cable tension allows full flexion and smooth return.  
- Use PLA or PETG printed parts with ≥ 40 % infill for structural sections.  
- Confirm proper alignment between elbow, wrist, and hand axes before final assembly.
