# Electronics (Optional)

This folder stores any electronic components, wiring diagrams, or control circuits associated with the prosthesis.

## If active control is added
Include:
- Schematic diagrams (`.pdf`, `.fzz`, `.png`)
- Component list (servos, sensors, microcontrollers)
- Connection maps (color-coded wiring)
- Voltage and power notes

Currently, the main build is passive (body-powered). Future work may explore myoelectric or servo-based actuation.
